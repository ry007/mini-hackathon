# Memory Atlas
A project developed as a part of Google Applied CS with Android workshop.
This project is an application of the classic Atlas game with an extension that a player must repeat the entire sequence of recited places before adding the new place.

### Atlas

Atlas is a collection of maps. However it has been used frequently to play a multiplayer game.
Each player names a country, state or continent that starts with the alphabet which was the previous player's answer's last alphabet. The game goes on till the players who cannot name a place are eliminated.

### Memory game

### Computing Score

To make things interesting, each alphabet has an associated score with it based on how rarely it is used in words. The final score upon declaring is the user's score. The user can declare at any point of time. The player with the highest score wins!
